Hi, I am Atharva Haldankar, a MS student at Virginia Tech. My research interests include Applied Cryptography and Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML). 
In my spare time, I enjoy spending time in the outdoors and playing board games with my family. One of my favorite board games is the Settlers of Catan.
